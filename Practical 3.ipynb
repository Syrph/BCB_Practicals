For models with few data points it depends on the number of predictors. If there's few predictors, like in our model, that means that we can accept lower F statistics. We can be more confident in our relationship if we used fewer predictors to describe it. If we use lots of predictors, we can be less certain in our model, because each predictor may explain some of the variation just by chance. Therefore we need a higher F statistic.
