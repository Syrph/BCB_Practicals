This is calculated by weighing up the degrees of freedom against our test statistic, and tells us what the chance is that we observed the same pattern in our data given that there was no relationship, i.e. the null hypothesis is true. \n",

Because traits at a macro scale are often driven by multiple selection pressures, which may sometimes be species-specific, we typically explain less variation than smaller more targeted studies. \n",

        "`Adjusted R squared`: This also explains the varition in response, but penalises us for including more predictors. This reduces the chances of over-fitting models with lots of predictors that don't contribute much. This is the R-squared that tends to be reported in publications. \n",

They are calculated from the number of independent data points in your model, minus the number of predictors. This is to prevent models that over-fit the data.

For models with few data points it depends on the number of predictors. If there's few predictors, like in our model, that means that we can accept lower F statistics. We can be more confident in our relationship if we used fewer predictors to describe it. If we use lots of predictors, we can be less certain in our model, because each predictor may explain some of the variation just by chance. Therefore we need a higher F statistic.

What's more interesting is latitude. We can see a significant p-value, so there is a relationship between latitude and body mass.
