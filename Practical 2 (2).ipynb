A refresher of phylogenetic trees\n\nThis section will review some basic aspects of phylogenetic trees and introduce how trees are handled at the level of software. Because you are now interacting with phylogenetic trees at a ‘lower level’ (i.e. at the bioinformatics level), it is also helpful to know some of the names for parts of phylogenetic trees used in computer science.\n\n### A. Tree parameters\n \nA phylogenetic tree is an ordered, multifurcating graph with labeled **tips** (or **leaves**) (and sometimes labeled histories). It represents the relative degrees of relationships of species (i.e. tips or OTUs). The graph consists of a series of **branches** (or **edges**) with join successively towards **nodes** (or **vertices**, *sing.* **vertex**). Each node is subtended by a single branch, representing the lineage of ancestors leading to a node. The node is thus the common ancestor of two or more descendant branches. All the descendant branches of a given node (and all of the their respective descendants) are said to form a **clade** (or **monophyletic group**)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# rtree creates a random tree.

This representation is called an **ultrametric** tree."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tree <- read.tree(text = \"(((Homo:6.3, Pan:6.3):2.5, Gorilla:8.8):6.9, Pongo:15.7);\")\nplot(tree)\naxisPhylo()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### B. Informatic representations of tree\n\nTo perform any useful calculations on a tree, we need both a computer-readable tree format and (in part) to understand how trees are constructed in computer memory.\n \n#### Text based formats\n\nStorage of trees for transfer between different software is essential. This is most commonly achieved with a text-based format stored in a file. The most common file format for representing phylogenetic trees is **Newick format**. This consists of clades represented within parentheses. Commas separate each clade. Either tip names or symbols representing the tips are nested within the lowest orders of parentheses. Each tip or branch can be associated with a branch length scalar that follows a colon.\n\nFor example:\n\n`\"(((Homo, Pan), Gorilla), Pongo);\"`\n\nOr with branch length:\n\n`\"(((Homo:6.3, Pan:6.3):2.5, Gorilla:8.8):6.9, Pongo:15.7);\"`\n\nTrees are also increasing use of XML formats such as PhyloXML and NeXML.\n\nIn this practical we are going to use the `elopomorph.tre` newick tree.\nYou can open it with a simple text editor to see the newick tree structure.\n\n#### Edge table\n\nIt is also possible to represent a phylogenetic tree as a matrix of edges and vertices called an edge table. This is an even less intuitive representation, but it is implemented in `R` and worth reviewing here.\n\nThere are a number of conventions that can be used to create an edge table. The general concept consists of numbering the tips *1 - n*, and all internal nodes labeled *n+1 ... n+n-1*. The numbers for the internal nodes can be assigned arbitrarily or according to an algorithm.\n\nIn `R` packages like `ape`, edge tables are constructed as follows:\n\n| node | connects to |\n|---|---|\n| 5 | 6 |\n| 6 | 7 |\n| 7 | 1 |\n| 7 | 2 |\n| 6 | 3 |\n| 5 | 4 |\n\nYou read the table as follows: node `5` (root) connects to node `6`. The node `6` connects to node `7`. Node `7` connects to node `1` that happen to be the first tip (`Homo`) and to node `2` (`Pan`) etc... Note that in a binary tree (i.e. a tree where each node has only two descendants) each node always connects to two elements (nodes or tips)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tree <- read.tree(text = \"(((Homo, Pan), Gorilla), Pongo);\")\nplot(tree, label.offset = 0.1)\nnodelabels() ; tiplabels()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Records & pointers\n\nAt a lower level, phylogenetic trees can be represented in computer memory as more complex data objects. We don’t need to go into detail here, but if you consider nodes and tips as data objects (i.e. a dataframe), a tree could be stored as an array of dataframes which store information about which store information about which members of that same array are descendants and which are ancestors.\n\n### 3.
